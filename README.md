Graph Clock
===========
An analog clock, but as graphs,  
inspired by a conversation with a friend.

Originally to show when all hands were exactly on top one another,  
this clock shows you the postion of all three clock hands.

The Y-Axis shows the position of the hands on the clock as minutes,  
the X-Axis shows the current time in a 12h format.

In version 2, the Y-Axis shows the *"height"* of each hand,  
making beautiful curves.
